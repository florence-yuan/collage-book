Inspired by Max Ernst's 1929 work _The Hundred Headless Woman_.

Each collage is made by digitally combining vintage prints with actual photos.

Between the demolition of old neighborhoods and the mysterious appearance of half-goat, half-human creatures, the line between reason and disorder begins to blur... A story about change and memory.
