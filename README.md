Inspired by Max Ernst's 1929 work _The Hundred Headless Woman_.

Each collage is made by digitally combining vintage prints with actual photos of Shanghainese neighborhoods taken by me and my family members.

Between the demolition of old neighborhoods and the mysterious appearance of half-goat, half-human creatures, the lines between reason and savagery begin to blur... A story about change and memory.
